<h1>Personal Best Games</h1>

<h2>My top 5 games of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3>
  <p>This is my favourite game. It makes me feel the joy of playing when i was a kid all over again. 
    <br />Its sequel is objectively better but didn't have the same impact for me personally.</p>
<h3>The Last of Us</h3>
  <p>A games with a great story accompanied with satisfying gameplay.</p>
<h3>Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>
  <p>It's simply a beautiful game graphicaly and a technically sound game like its previous remake in the series. 
    <br /> Gameplay-wise it is similar compared to the Resident evil 2 and 3 remake which are also great games, <br />with some quality of life feature and improvement, for instance knife-parrying is a nice touch.</p>
<h3>Uncharted 4</h3>
  <p>Entertaining game with a movie-like experience. <br /> Just sit back enjoy all the platforming, shooting, driving goodness packaged in a enjoyable story.</p>
<h3>Subnautica</h3>
  <p>Survival game with a great gameplay in term of exploration, immersion, overall progression in this type of genre.</p>
